This is my customization of the public template [jackyzha0/quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz).

I use it to publish my obsidian vault online, while keep the vault itself private. The source files lay in a private repo as a submodule of this, and only selected articles are published. I am willing to open source, but my vault contains some work stuff and personal scratches which are not suitable for public.

This is my final way to share my notes online, while keep something private. Thanks to Quartz!

I have tried obsidian plugin digital-garden, obsidian-webpage-export, but none fits my need. Now I want to provide some ideas.

Idea 1
------

Setup quartz in your obsidian vault (of course keep the repo private), publish the built htmls (static websites) to another public repo using github actions.

Idea 2
------

Setup quartz in public repo, just follow 

1. [Welcome to Quartz 4 - Get Started](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/#-get-started)
2. [Setting up your GitHub repository](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/setting-up-your-GitHub-repository)

then add your obsidian vault as a submodule.

**Yes, I choose this one.**
